# Investor-Calculator

The `InvestorCalc` program is designed to help users manage and analyze their investment portfolios. The program starts by prompting the user to enter the number of investments they have. For each investment, the user is asked to provide the investment's name and its current value. As the user inputs this data, the program keeps track of the total sum invested, as well as identifying the highest and lowest investment amounts and their respective names. 

Once all data is entered, the program prints a summary report that includes the total invested amount, daily, weekly, and monthly average investments, and an estimated 10% annual growth amount. Additionally, the program highlights the highest and lowest investments with their corresponding amounts and names. The use of formatted output ensures that all monetary values are displayed with two decimal places for clarity.
